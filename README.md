## Description
As a developer, I must present myself as a part of the developer community. This is done by creating a place where I can share the projects I have creaeted as well as present it in a fashion that displays the growth I have obtained from the time I have dedicatied to my career. This portfolio is the ideal place to show other developers my skills but also present to potential employers for career advancement. Furthermore, this portfolio showcases my experiences and skills to future collaborators I may connect with for future projects.
